# Quix Streams

Quix Streams is an open-source Python library that provides a high-level interface for processing and managing
streaming data. It allows easy understanding, transformation and
enrichment of streams through a simple API. In the system implementation,
Quix Streams is the key mechanism for managing and routing
data between Kafka, the learning models, and the presentation interface.
