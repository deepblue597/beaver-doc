# Dash

Dash is a framework based on Plotly, which allows
the development of fully functional web applications and dashboards using only Python. It provides tools for creating interactive
user elements such as buttons, sliders and forms, allowing interaction with
graphs and updating them in real-time, without
requiring knowledge of frontend technologies such as JavaScript or HTML
