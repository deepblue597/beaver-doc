# Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed (message broker) system designed for large-scale data flows in real-
time. It provides high reliability and fault tolerance, making it
ideal for connecting sensors or external data sources to
the application infrastructure. In this paper, Kafka is used as a
source of data stream inputs, a repository of data generated by
the algorithm training and prediction processes, and as a
data repository.
The connection to the Kafka broker is established through the Python library
confluent_kafka, which is the official Confluent client[15] for al-
eration with Kafka. This library was chosen because of its
extensive user manual and its simplicity in implementation.
