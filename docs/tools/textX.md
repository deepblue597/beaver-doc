# textX

textX is a compilation tool for building Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), which is based on Python and uses the Arpeggio tool for syntax analysis. It allows defining the grammar of a language in a simple way and automatically generating an abstract syntax tree (AST). In the context of this paper, it is used to design the DSL that describes the data flow and the steps of machine learning.
