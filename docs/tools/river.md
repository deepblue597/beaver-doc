# River

River is a Python library for machine learning on streaming data (online machine learning). Unlike traditional libraries that
are trained in batch learning, River supports incremental learning, making it ideal for environments with a continuous
stream of data. In this work, it is used for classification,
regression, anomaly detection, concept drift
management, forecasting and other techniques for real-time
data, as well as for model evaluation
with continuous updates
