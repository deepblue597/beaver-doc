# Comments

The language defines two types of comments:

- **CommentLine:** Single-line comment that starts with `//` and continues to the end of the line.
- **CommentBlock:** Multi-line comment that starts with `/*` and ends with `*/`, allowing text or whitespace in between.

This definition enables correct recognition and ignoring of comments during code parsing.
