# Model Groups

Entities of type `ModelGroups` define the broader categories (or "families") of ModelModules. This classification serves to categorize the different functional roles that modules perform within the context of building a machine learning pipeline.

The available groups are as follows:

- `AlgoGroup`: Core prediction and classification algorithms
- `FeatureGroup`: Feature extraction methods
- `OptimGroup`: Optimizers
- `PreprocGroup`: Preprocessing techniques
- `MetricGroup`: Evaluation metrics
- `ComposeGroup`: Composite algorithms (wrappers, ensembles, etc.)
- `StatsGroup`: Statistics
